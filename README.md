After installing arch I usually install a minimal GNOME version, with Papirus and Bibata-Classic for icons and cursors

## This script has
-Gnome packages
- gnome-shell
- gnome-control-center
- nautilus
- gdm
- gnome-text-editor
- gnome-tweaks

-Makeup

  - Papirus Adwaita Icons (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/)
 - Bibata Modern Classic Cursors (https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor)
 - Bash line editor like Zsh for bash (https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh)
 - Alacritty terminal and custom .toml
 - fastfetch
 - bash custom PS1 
##### After rebooting, open GNOME Tweaks to apply your icon and cursor themes. You can also set the included wallpaper if desired
